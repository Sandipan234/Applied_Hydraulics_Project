<h1 align="center"> Failure Prediction In Pumps Using Multi-Variate Statistics</h1>

Since the Recent, Decades Condition Based Monitoring of Hydraulics System has been gaining popularity .</br>
Thereby, machine downtimes and maintenance costs are reduced, but also planning security of production can be enhanced considerably.</br>
In General, there are two condition monitoring philosophies</br>
<ol>
    <li> <b>The Model Based approach</b> which requires detailed physical and mathematical knowledge about the system's behaiviour which is difficult to obtain with sufficient details for increasingly complex system</li>
    <li> <b>The Statistical Approach</b> which is based on analysis of previously observed faults and associated measurement data and requires a sufficient quantity of historical data
    
</ol>

### Aim Of this Project

<b>The Aim of the project is to use the methods of Statistical Learning to develop a model for predicting the failure of a Pump system based on the data recived by the sensor and compare the results predicted by the models</b>
